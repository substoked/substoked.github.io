Our time was up at our original temporary accomodation and we were looking
forward to moving into somewhere more permanent. Unfortunately our apartments
still weren't ready so we had to move into another temporary house. We had to
get in one last hot tub though!

The upside of the new place was that it was much closer to the ski hill, walking
distance even! We also had some pretty cool new neighbours
