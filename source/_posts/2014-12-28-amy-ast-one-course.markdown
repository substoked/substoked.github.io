Being in an amazing winter wonderland we wanted to make sure that we could get
out into the backcountry and experience skiing more than just the resort. Amy
attended the AST 1 course. Which covers the fundamentals of travelling in
avalanche terrain. It includes one classroom day and one full day in the field.
This meant that Amy had to be kitted out with the avalanche survival essentials
of tranceiver, probe and shovel.
