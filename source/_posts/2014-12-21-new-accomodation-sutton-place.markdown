Unfortunately the septic tank in our temporary accomodation broke and we had to
quickly move out. Fortunately our new accomodation was the
[Sutton Place hotel](https://www.suttonplace.com) which is the hotel at the bottom
of the first gondola!

The hotel rooms are super fancy and we have use of an outdoor pool and hot tub!
